Overview¶

A view is a “type” of Web page in your Django application that generally serves a specific function and has a specific template. For example, in a blog application, you might have the following views:

    Blog homepage – displays the latest few entries.
    Entry “detail” page – permalink page for a single entry.
    Year-based archive page – displays all months with entries in the given year.
    Month-based archive page – displays all days with entries in the given month.
    Day-based archive page – displays all entries in the given day.
    Comment action – handles posting comments to a given entry.
